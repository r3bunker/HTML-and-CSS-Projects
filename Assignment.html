		It was February 4, 2018, when the Philadelphia Eagles won their first-ever NFL Super Bowl Championship. For the team, the city, and the fans, the world changed as the Philadelphia Eagles will forever be Super Bowl LII Champions.
		

		This franchise-changing victory was 57 years in the making. The previous time that the Eagles won an NFL Championship was December 26, 1960, at Philadelphia’s Franklin Field when the Eagles defeated the Green Bay Packers, 17-13. The 1960 title came 11 years after the Eagles strung together back-to-back championships in 1948 (7-0 triumph over the Chicago Cardinals at Philadelphia’s Shibe Park) and 1949 (14-0 victory over the Los Angeles Rams at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum).
